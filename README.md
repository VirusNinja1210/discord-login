This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

> Note: Make sure you create a .env file at the root of the repository and add your clientid and client secret.

Also, make sure the API is running on port 3001 as the frontend is sending requests to the API running on localhost:3001 you can do this via:

```bash
cd api
```
```bash
node index.js
```
